Website

## HTML

* Starting with the HTML I mapped out everything using semantic code.
* I added markers for where I was going to use CSS, and used the '#' symbol as a place-holder.
* The HTML was very straightforward.

## CSS
*The CSS I created was more compex than what I think it needed to be. I will more than likely go back and revise. 

* I started by selecting the colors I was going to use, and setting them to var to make universal changes easy.
* Next I adjusted body and H tags.
* Then I began to work on the header and navigation bar. As I progressed, I used a lot of comments to keep up with what I was changing for myself. They probably will not be as useful for someone looking in on the comments. 
* I found great difficulty with the flex boxes, but was able to set them up and get them working.
* Images where easy to install, and was one of the first things I did as I worked on the project.

## Push

* When I pushed my code to github, the website would not display. I tried changing the file order repeatedly, but eventully, I had to delete the first repository.
* For the second repository, the website worked, but the pictures were not linking.
* I changed files, folders, remained, and triple checked everything, but the images would not pop up.
* Two hours later, after making final adjustments, I was able to get the photos to pop up. Phew.
