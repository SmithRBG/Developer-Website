# Developer-Website
Website

## Code

This website is built using strictly CSS and HTML to create a landing page for works I have created over the past few months, some backend heavy, some frontend heavy.
The HTML is barebones, but the CSS is very detailed and gives a step by step break down of all the changes made to create the final result.
